    "The recommended way of running Whisper JAX is through the [`FlaxWhisperPipline`](https://github.com/sanchit-gandhi/whisper-jax/blob/main/whisper_jax/pipeline.py#L57) class. This class handles all the necessary pre- and post-processing for the model, as well as wrapping the generate method for data parallelism across all available accelerator devices.\n",

    "Whisper JAX makes use of JAX's [`pmap`](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.pmap.html) function for data parallelism across GPU/TPU devices. This function is Just In Time (JIT) compiled the first time it is called. Thereafter, the function will be cached, enabling it to be run in super-fast time.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's load the large-v2 model in bfloat16 (half-precision). Using half-precision will speed-up the computation quite considerably by storing intermediate tensors in half-precision. There is no change to the precision of the model weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also make use of _batching_ for single audio inputs: the audio is first chunked into 30 second segments, and then chunks dispatched to the model to be transcribed in parallel. By batching an audio input and transcribing it in parallel, we get a ~10x speed-up compared to transcribing the audio samples sequentially."

      "{'text': \" Chapter 16. I might have told you of the beginning of this liaison in a few lines, but I wanted you to see every step by which we came, I to agree to whatever Marguerite wished, Marguerite to be unable to live apart from me. It was the day after the evening when she came to see me that I sent her Manon Lescate. From that time, seeing that I could not change my mistress's life, I changed my own. I wished above all not to leave myself time to think over the position I had accepted, for, in spite of myself, it was a great distress to me. Thus my life, generally so calm, assumed all at once an appearance of noise and disorder. Never believe, however disinterested the love of a kept woman may be, that it will cost one nothing. Nothing is so expensive as their caprices, flowers, boxes at the theatre, suppers, days in the country, which one can never refuse to one's mistress. As I have told you, I had little money. My father was, and still is, Receiver General at sea. He has a great reputation there for loyalty, thanks to which he was able to find the security which he needed in order to attain this position. I came to Paris, studied law, was called to the bar, and, like many other young men, put my diploma in my pocket, and let myself drift, as one so easily does in Paris. My expenses were very moderate, only I used up my year's income in eight months, and spent the four summer months with my father, which practically gave me twelve thousand francs a year, and, in addition, the reputation of a good son. For the rest, not a penny of debt. This, then, was my position when I made the acquaintance of Marguerite. You can well understand that, in spite of myself, my expenses soon increased. Marguerite's nature was very capricious, and, like so many women, she never regarded as a serious expense those thousand and one distractions which made up her life. So, wishing to spend as much time with me as possible, she would write to me in the morning that she would dine with me, not at home, but at some restaurant in Paris, or in the country. I would call for her, and we would dine and go on to the theatre, often having supper as well. Forgive me if I give you all these details, but you will see that they were the cause of what was to follow. What I tell you is a true and simple story, and I leave to it all the naivete of its details, and all the simplicity of its developments. I realized then that as nothing in the world would make me forget my mistress, it was needful for me to find some way of meeting the expenses into which she drew me. Then, too, my love for her had so disturbing an influence upon me, that every moment I spent away from Marguerite was like a year, and that I felt the need of consuming these moments in the fire of some sort of passion, as not to know that I was living them. I began by borrowing five or six thousand francs on my little capital, and with this I took to gambling. Since gambling-houses were destroyed, gambling goes on everywhere. Formerly, when one went to Frascati, one had the chance of making a fortune, one played against money, and if one lost, there was always the consolation of saying that one might have gained. Whereas now, except in the clubs, where there is still a certain rigour in regard to payments, one is almost certain, the moment one gains a considerable sum, not to receive it. You will readily understand why. Gambling is only likely to be carried on by young people very much in need of money, and not possessing the fortune necessary for supporting the life they lead. They gamble, then, and with this result, or else they gain, and then those who lose serve to pay for their horses and mistresses, which is very disagreeable. Debts are contracted, acquaintances begun about a green table, and by quarrels in which life or honour comes to grief, and though one may be an honest man, one finds oneself ruined by very honest men, whose only defect is that they have not two hundred thousand francs a year. I need not tell you of those who cheat at play. I flung myself into this rapid, noisy, and volcanic life, which had formerly terrified me when I thought of it, and which had become for me the necessary complement of my love for Marguerite. What else could I have done? The nights that I did not spend in the Rue d'Antin, if I had spent them alone in my own room, I could not have slept. Jealousy would have kept me awake, and inflamed my blood and my thoughts.\"}\n"
